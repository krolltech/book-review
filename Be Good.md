(本文来自于2008年开学典礼上的讨论.)

About a month after we started Y Combinator we came up with the phrase that became our motto: Make something people want. We've learned a lot since then, but if I were choosing now that's still the one I'd pick.
大约1个月后我们开始创办了YC孵化器,我们的座右铭就是:满足人们的需求,从那时起,我们学到了很多东西,即便是现在,我仍然会那样选择.

Another thing we tell founders is not to worry too much about the business model, at least at first. Not because making money is unimportant, but because it's so much easier than building something great.
另外我们告诉创业者不要太过于担心商业模式,尤其是最开始的时候.并不是说赚钱不重要,但是相比那些做一些伟大的事情相比确实不值得一提.

A couple weeks ago I realized that if you put those two ideas together, you get something surprising. Make something people want. Don't worry too much about making money. What you've got is a description of a charity.
几个星球以前,我把两者结合起来得到一个令人吃惊的结论,满足人们的需求,但是不要在乎金钱,这是慈善吧.

When you get an unexpected result like this, it could either be a bug or a new discovery. Either businesses aren't supposed to be like charities, and we've proven by reductio ad absurdum that one or both of the principles we began with is false. Or we have a new idea.
当你得到一个意想不到的结论的时候,你要知道它要么是个bug,要么是一个真正的发现,根据反证法的原则,其中一个或者两个都是假的,否则我们有了新的发现。

I suspect it's the latter, because as soon as this thought occurred to me, a whole bunch of other things fell into place.
我怀疑是后者,因为从这个观念在我头脑中形成的时候,其他的事情都被我抛在脑后了。
