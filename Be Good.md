(本文来自于2008年开学典礼上的讨论.)

About a month after we started Y Combinator we came up with the phrase that became our motto: Make something people want. We've learned a lot since then, but if I were choosing now that's still the one I'd pick.  
大约1个月后我们开始创办了YC孵化器,我们的座右铭就是:满足人们的需求,从那时起,我们学到了很多东西,即便是现在,我仍然会那样选择.

Another thing we tell founders is not to worry too much about the business model, at least at first. Not because making money is unimportant, but because it's so much easier than building something great.   
另外我们告诉创业者不要太过于担心商业模式,尤其是最开始的时候.并不是说赚钱不重要,但是相比那些做一些伟大的事情相比确实不值得一提.

A couple weeks ago I realized that if you put those two ideas together, you get something surprising. Make something people want. Don't worry too much about making money. What you've got is a description of a charity.   
几个星球以前,我把两者结合起来得到一个令人吃惊的结论,满足人们的需求,但是不要在乎金钱,这是慈善吧.

When you get an unexpected result like this, it could either be a bug or a new discovery. Either businesses aren't supposed to be like charities, and we've proven by reductio ad absurdum that one or both of the principles we began with is false. Or we have a new idea.   
当你得到一个意想不到的结论的时候,你要知道它要么是个bug,要么是一个真正的发现,根据反证法的原则,其中一个或者两个都是假的,否则我们有了新的发现。

I suspect it's the latter, because as soon as this thought occurred to me, a whole bunch of other things fell into place.   
我怀疑是后者,因为从这个观念在我头脑中形成的时候,其他的事情都被我抛在脑后了。

**例子**
For example, Craigslist. It's not a charity, but they run it like one. And they're astoundingly successful. When you scan down the list of most popular web sites, the number of employees at Craigslist looks like a misprint. Their revenues aren't as high as they could be, but most startups would be happy to trade places with them.  
比如说Craigslist,他们就是这样的做的,惊人的成功,但是显然他们不是慈善结构。当你搜索整个流行网站的时候,Craigslist的员工的页面好像是发生了印刷错误一样。他们的收入仿佛和他们所做的事情并不匹配,但是大多数创业公司却很乐意和他们交换位置。

In Patrick O'Brian's novels, his captains always try to get upwind of their opponents. If you're upwind, you decide when and if to engage the other ship. Craigslist is effectively upwind of enormous revenues. They'd face some challenges if they wanted to make more, but not the sort you face when you're tacking upwind, trying to force a crappy product on ambivalent users by spending ten times as much on sales as on development.   
帕特里克-奥不莱恩的小说里面,他的船长总是努力的处于对手的上风。如果你处于上风,你将决定什么时候或者是否跟随其他的船只。Craigslist有效的处于收入的上风,加入他们想要获得更多,就会面临更大的挑战,但是如果你只是紧跟上风,去制造一些蹩脚的、用途模糊不清的产品只会成倍的浪费用户的时间。  

I'm not saying startups should aim to end up like Craigslist. They're a product of unusual circumstances. But they're a good model for the early phases.

Google looked a lot like a charity in the beginning. They didn't have ads for over a year. At year 1, Google was indistinguishable from a nonprofit. If a nonprofit or government organization had started a project to index the web, Google at year 1 is the limit of what they'd have produced.

Back when I was working on spam filters I thought it would be a good idea to have a web-based email service with good spam filtering. I wasn't thinking of it as a company. I just wanted to keep people from getting spammed. But as I thought more about this project, I realized it would probably have to be a company. It would cost something to run, and it would be a pain to fund with grants and donations.

That was a surprising realization. Companies often claim to be benevolent, but it was surprising to realize there were purely benevolent projects that had to be embodied as companies to work.

I didn't want to start another company, so I didn't do it. But if someone had, they'd probably be quite rich now. There was a window of about two years when spam was increasing rapidly but all the big email services had terrible filters. If someone had launched a new, spam-free mail service, users would have flocked to it.

Notice the pattern here? From either direction we get to the same spot. If you start from successful startups, you find they often behaved like nonprofits. And if you start from ideas for nonprofits, you find they'd often make good startups.
