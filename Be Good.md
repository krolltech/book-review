(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2008 Startup School.)
(本文来自于2008年开学典礼上的讨论.)

About a month after we started Y Combinator we came up with the phrase that became our motto: Make something people want. We've learned a lot since then, but if I were choosing now that's still the one I'd pick.  
大约1个月后我们开始创办了YC孵化器,我们的座右铭就是:满足人们的需求,从那时起,我们学到了很多东西,即便是现在,我仍然会那样选择.

Another thing we tell founders is not to worry too much about the business model, at least at first. Not because making money is unimportant, but because it's so much easier than building something great.   
另外我们告诉创业者不要太过于担心商业模式,尤其是最开始的时候.并不是说赚钱不重要,但是相比那些做一些伟大的事情相比确实不值得一提.

A couple weeks ago I realized that if you put those two ideas together, you get something surprising. Make something people want. Don't worry too much about making money. What you've got is a description of a charity.   
几个星期以前,我把两者结合起来得到一个令人吃惊的结论,满足人们的需求,但是不要在乎金钱,这是在做慈善事业吧.

When you get an unexpected result like this, it could either be a bug or a new discovery. Either businesses aren't supposed to be like charities, and we've proven by reductio ad absurdum that one or both of the principles we began with is false. Or we have a new idea.   
当你得到一个意想不到的结论的时候,你要知道它要么是个bug,要么是一个真正的发现,根据反证法的原则,其中一个或者两个都是假的,否则我们有了新的发现。

I suspect it's the latter, because as soon as this thought occurred to me, a whole bunch of other things fell into place.   
我怀疑是后者,因为从这个观念在我头脑中形成的时候,其他的事情都被我抛在脑后了。

**例子**
For example, Craigslist. It's not a charity, but they run it like one. And they're astoundingly successful. When you scan down the list of most popular web sites, the number of employees at Craigslist looks like a misprint. Their revenues aren't as high as they could be, but most startups would be happy to trade places with them.  
比如说Craigslist,他们就是这样的做的,惊人的成功,但是显然他们不是慈善结构。当你搜索整个流行网站的时候,Craigslist的员工的页面好像是发生了印刷错误一样。他们的收入仿佛和他们所做的事情并不匹配,但是大多数创业公司却很乐意和他们交换位置。

In Patrick O'Brian's novels, his captains always try to get upwind of their opponents. If you're upwind, you decide when and if to engage the other ship. Craigslist is effectively upwind of enormous revenues. They'd face some challenges if they wanted to make more, but not the sort you face when you're tacking upwind, trying to force a crappy product on ambivalent users by spending ten times as much on sales as on development.   
帕特里克-奥不莱恩的小说里面,他的船长总是努力的处于对手的上风。如果你处于上风,你将决定什么时候或者是否跟随其他的船只。Craigslist有效的处于收入的上风,加入他们想要获得更多,就会面临更大的挑战,但是如果你只是紧跟上风,去制造一些蹩脚的、用途模糊不清的产品只会成倍的浪费用户的时间。  

I'm not saying startups should aim to end up like Craigslist. They're a product of unusual circumstances. But they're a good model for the early phases.  
我并不是说创业公司应该像Craigslist一样结束。他们是一个不同寻常的产品。但他们的模式应该是初期所效仿的。  

Google looked a lot like a charity in the beginning. They didn't have ads for over a year. At year 1, Google was indistinguishable from a nonprofit. If a nonprofit or government organization had started a project to index the web, Google at year 1 is the limit of what they'd have produced.
谷歌刚开始就好像是在做慈善事业。他们一年多没有投放广告,第一年,谷歌公司和一个非盈利性的结构没有什么分别。假如一个非盈利性或者政府型的结构已经开始对网页进行索引工作,那么谷歌的产出就会非常的受限。  

Back when I was working on spam filters I thought it would be a good idea to have a web-based email service with good spam filtering. I wasn't thinking of it as a company. I just wanted to keep people from getting spammed. But as I thought more about this project, I realized it would probably have to be a company. It would cost something to run, and it would be a pain to fund with grants and donations.   
回到我设计邮件垃圾过滤器的时候,我认为如果有一个很好的基于web服务垃圾邮件过滤器将是一个很好的主意。我并没有想把它做成一个公司。我仅仅是想人们远离垃圾邮件的侵害。但是我随着对这个项目更多的思考,我意识到可能不得不成立公司。它需要很多花费才能运行起来,靠获得资助、捐赠来维持将会显得非常的痛苦。  

That was a surprising realization. Companies often claim to be benevolent, but it was surprising to realize there were purely benevolent projects that had to be embodied as companies to work.   
这是一个非常令人惊讶的实现,公司常常声称自己是善意的,但是其中惊讶的政绩工程却不得不像公司那样运作才能得以实现。   

I didn't want to start another company, so I didn't do it. But if someone had, they'd probably be quite rich now. There was a window of about two years when spam was increasing rapidly but all the big email services had terrible filters. If someone had launched a new, spam-free mail service, users would have flocked to it.   
我不想开创另外一个公司,所以我没有做到这一点。但是有的人做到了,现在他们很可能相当的富有。大约有那么一两年的时间,垃圾邮件猖獗泛滥,所有的垃圾邮件服务商在垃圾邮件过滤器上都有很大的麻烦。如果有人推出了免费的反烦垃圾邮件服务,那么大家都会涌向它。  

Notice the pattern here? From either direction we get to the same spot. If you start from successful startups, you find they often behaved like nonprofits. And if you start from ideas for nonprofits, you find they'd often make good startups.   
这里面有固定的模式吗? 从任意方向我们都得到一个相同点。加入你成功的创业,你会发现他们经常表现的像个非盈利性的组织。如果你从事非盈利性的想法开始,你会发现他们通常能做出良好的公司。
