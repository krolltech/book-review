#Be Good - Paul Graham (April 2008)
===
[原文链接](http://www.paulgraham.com/good.html)

**(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2008 Startup School.)**   
```
(本文来自于2008年开学典礼上的讨论.)
```

**About a month after we started Y Combinator we came up with the phrase that became our motto: Make something people want. We've learned a lot since then, but if I were choosing now that's still the one I'd pick.**  
```
大约1个月后我们开始创办了YC孵化器,我们的座右铭就是:满足人们的需求,从那时起,我们学到了很多东西,即便是现在,我仍然会那样选择。
```

**Another thing we tell founders is not to worry too much about the business model, at least at first. Not because making money is unimportant, but because it's so much easier than building something great.**   
```
另外我们告诉创业者不要太过于担心商业模式,尤其是最开始的时候。并不是说赚钱不重要,但是相比那些做一些伟大的事情相比确实不值得一提。
```

**A couple weeks ago I realized that if you put those two ideas together, you get something surprising. Make something people want. Don't worry too much about making money. What you've got is a description of a charity.**   
```
几个星期以前,我把两者结合起来得到一个令人吃惊的结论,满足人们的需求,但是不要在乎金钱,这是在做慈善事业吧。
```

**When you get an unexpected result like this, it could either be a bug or a new discovery. Either businesses aren't supposed to be like charities, and we've proven by reductio ad absurdum that one or both of the principles we began with is false. Or we have a new idea.**   
```
当你得到一个意想不到的结论的时候,你要知道它要么是个bug,要么是一个真正的发现,根据反证法的原则,其中一个或者两个都是假的,否则我们有了新的发现。
```

**I suspect it's the latter, because as soon as this thought occurred to me, a whole bunch of other things fell into place.**   
```
我怀疑是后者,因为从这个观念在我头脑中形成的时候,其他的事情都被我抛在脑后了。
```

#例子  
**For example, Craigslist. It's not a charity, but they run it like one. And they're astoundingly successful. When you scan down the list of most popular web sites, the number of employees at Craigslist looks like a misprint. Their revenues aren't as high as they could be, but most startups would be happy to trade places with them.**  
```
比如说Craigslist,他们就是这样的做的,惊人的成功,但是显然他们不是慈善结构。当你搜索整个流行网站的时候,Craigslist的员工的页面好像是发生了印刷错误一样。他们的收入仿佛和他们所做的事情并不匹配,但是大多数创业公司却很乐意和他们交换位置。
```

**In Patrick O'Brian's novels, his captains always try to get upwind of their opponents. If you're upwind, you decide when and if to engage the other ship. Craigslist is effectively upwind of enormous revenues. They'd face some challenges if they wanted to make more, but not the sort you face when you're tacking upwind, trying to force a crappy product on ambivalent users by spending ten times as much on sales as on development.**   
```
帕特里克-奥不莱恩的小说里面,他的船长总是努力的处于对手的上风。如果你处于上风,你将决定什么时候或者是否跟随其他的船只。Craigslist有效的处于收入的上风,加入他们想要获得更多,就会面临更大的挑战,但是如果你只是紧跟上风,去制造一些蹩脚的、用途模糊不清的产品只会成倍的浪费用户的时间。  
```

**I'm not saying startups should aim to end up like Craigslist. They're a product of unusual circumstances. But they're a good model for the early phases.**  
```
我并不是说创业公司应该像Craigslist一样结束。他们是一个不同寻常的产品。但他们的模式应该是初期所效仿的。
```  

**Google looked a lot like a charity in the beginning. They didn't have ads for over a year. At year 1, Google was indistinguishable from a nonprofit. If a nonprofit or government organization had started a project to index the web, Google at year 1 is the limit of what they'd have produced.**
```
谷歌刚开始就好像是在做慈善事业。他们一年多没有投放广告,第一年,谷歌公司和一个非盈利性的结构没有什么分别。假如一个非盈利性或者政府型的结构已经开始对网页进行索引工作,那么谷歌的产出就会非常的受限。  
```

**Back when I was working on spam filters I thought it would be a good idea to have a web-based email service with good spam filtering. I wasn't thinking of it as a company. I just wanted to keep people from getting spammed. But as I thought more about this project, I realized it would probably have to be a company. It would cost something to run, and it would be a pain to fund with grants and donations.**   
```
回到我设计邮件垃圾过滤器的时候,我认为如果有一个很好的基于web服务垃圾邮件过滤器将是一个很好的主意。我并没有想把它做成一个公司。我仅仅是想人们远离垃圾邮件的侵害。但是我随着对这个项目更多的思考,我意识到可能不得不成立公司。它需要很多花费才能运行起来,靠获得资助、捐赠来维持将会显得非常的痛苦。  
```

**That was a surprising realization. Companies often claim to be benevolent, but it was surprising to realize there were purely benevolent projects that had to be embodied as companies to work.**   
```
这是一个非常令人惊讶的实现,公司常常声称自己是善意的,但是其中惊讶的政绩工程却不得不像公司那样运作才能得以实现。
```   

**I didn't want to start another company, so I didn't do it. But if someone had, they'd probably be quite rich now. There was a window of about two years when spam was increasing rapidly but all the big email services had terrible filters. If someone had launched a new, spam-free mail service, users would have flocked to it.**   
```
我不想开创另外一个公司,所以我没有做到这一点。但是有的人做到了,现在他们很可能相当的富有。大约有那么一两年的时间,垃圾邮件猖獗泛滥,所有的垃圾邮件服务商在垃圾邮件过滤器上都有很大的麻烦。如果有人推出了免费的反烦垃圾邮件服务,那么大家都会涌向它。  
```

**Notice the pattern here? From either direction we get to the same spot. If you start from successful startups, you find they often behaved like nonprofits. And if you start from ideas for nonprofits, you find they'd often make good startups.**   
```
这里面有固定的模式吗? 从任意方向我们都得到一个相同点。加入你成功的创业,你会发现他们经常表现的像个非盈利性的组织。如果你从事非盈利性的想法开始,你会发现他们通常能做出良好的公司。  
```

#威力  
**How wide is this territory? Would all good nonprofits be good companies? Possibly not. What makes Google so valuable is that their users have money. If you make people with money love you, you can probably get some of it. But could you also base a successful startup on behaving like a nonprofit to people who don't have money? Could you, for example, grow a successful startup out of curing an unfashionable but deadly disease like malaria?**    
```
这里面有多大的可能性呢? 以非盈利性开始的都能成为好公司吗? 恐怕不是。让谷歌如此价值连城的是因为他们的用户有钱。 如果你能让有钱人喜欢你,你可能会得到一些。但是你能在一些没有钱的用户基础上成功的启动非盈利性的活动吗? 可以吗,举个例子,你成长的非常好,但是很不幸遭遇了致命的疾病,比如痢疾?   
```

**I'm not sure, but I suspect that if you pushed this idea, you'd be surprised how far it would go. For example, people who apply to Y Combinator don't generally have much money, and yet we can profit by helping them, because with our help they could make money. Maybe the situation is similar with malaria. Maybe an organization that helped lift its weight off a country could benefit from the resulting growth.**     
```
我不是很肯定,但是我非常怀疑你把这个想法付诸实践的时候能够走多远。举个例子,进入YC孵化器的人通常都没有钱,但是我们可以帮助他们赚取更多的钱而从中获利。可能和发生痢疾一样的情况。有可能一个帮助其减少体重的国家能够从成长的结果中获利。   
```

**I'm not proposing this is a serious idea. I don't know anything about malaria. But I've been kicking ideas around long enough to know when I come across a powerful one.**   
```
我不认为这是一个合格的想法。我对痢疾了解甚少。但是我知道长时间有这个想法能够带来多大的威力。  
```

**One way to guess how far an idea extends is to ask yourself at what point you'd bet against it. The thought of betting against benevolence is alarming in the same way as saying that something is technically impossible. You're just asking to be made a fool of, because these are such powerful forces.**  
```
猜测的想法能延伸多元取决你的抵触。这种想法和说某个技术是不可能实现的一样有害。你仅仅是被你的想法愚弄了,因为这种想法的威力非常强大。  
```

**For example, initially I thought maybe this principle only applied to Internet startups. Obviously it worked for Google, but what about Microsoft? Surely Microsoft isn't benevolent? But when I think back to the beginning, they were. Compared to IBM they were like Robin Hood. When IBM introduced the PC, they thought they were going to make money selling hardware at high prices. But by gaining control of the PC standard, Microsoft opened up the market to any manufacturer. Hardware prices plummeted, and lots of people got to have computers who couldn't otherwise have afforded them. It's the sort of thing you'd expect Google to do.**  
```
例如,最初我想这个想法可能只适用于互联网初创的公司. 但是很明显,谷歌就不是,那么对于微软公司呢? 当然微软不盈利吗? 但是我回想当初, 他们也是。和IBM相比,他们更像是罗宾汉。当IBM生产出PC,他们认为他们可以在硬件上卖很高的价钱。但是为了打破PC的垄断,微软对任何厂商开放市场。硬件价格暴跌,许多人拥有了以前买不起的电脑。那也是你希望谷歌所做的。
```

**Microsoft isn't so benevolent now. Now when one thinks of what Microsoft does to users, all the verbs that come to mind begin with F. And yet it doesn't seem to pay. Their stock price has been flat for years. Back when they were Robin Hood, their stock price rose like Google's. Could there be a connection?**   
```
微软现在也是没那么仁慈,现在某个人想起微软对用户的所为,所有的想法都起始于回归的时候。好像没人愿意付费。他们的股票加个持平了很多年。当初罗宾汉回归的时候,他们的股票价格像谷歌一样的增长。这里面有什么联系吗?    
```

**You can see how there would be. When you're small, you can't bully customers, so you have to charm them. Whereas when you're big you can maltreat them at will, and you tend to, because it's easier than satisfying them. You grow big by being nice, but you can stay big by being mean.**  
```
你可以看到哦啊,当你小的时候,你不能欺骗客户,所以你不得不保持你的魅力。当你做大以后,你可以剥削他们的意愿,你会的,因为满足他们是非常容易的。做大当然非常好,但困难的是你能够保持。
```

**You get away with it till the underlying conditions change, and then all your victims escape. So "Don't be evil" may be the most valuable thing Paul Buchheit made for Google, because it may turn out to be an elixir of corporate youth. I'm sure they find it constraining, but think how valuable it will be if it saves them from lapsing into the fatal laziness that afflicted Microsoft and IBM.**   
```
直到条件变化的时候,你才能摆脱它,并且你的所有的受害者都会逃离掉。因此不作恶可能是最有价值,因为它才是企业保持青春的灵丹妙药. 我敢肯定,他们遇到很多的限制,但是他们认为这是非常宝贵的,以免重蹈微软和IBM之覆辙。
```   

**The curious thing is, this elixir is freely available to any other company. Anyone can adopt "Don't be evil." The catch is that people will hold you to it. So I don't think you're going to see record labels or tobacco companies using this discovery.**    
```
奇怪的事情是这个灵丹妙药对任何公司都是免费的,任何人都可以采取不作恶的态度。意外的是人们只会让给你。所以我不认为你会看到唱片公司和烟草公司这样做。   
```

#士气  
**There's a lot of external evidence that benevolence works. But how does it work? One advantage of investing in a large number of startups is that you get a lot of data about how they work. From what we've seen, being good seems to help startups in three ways: it improves their morale, it makes other people want to help them, and above all, it helps them be decisive.**     
```
这儿有很多证据能够表明非盈利性的强大作用。但他是怎么做到的?大量初创公司投资的优势是可以得到很多数据。已经可以看到,对于创业公司有三个方面的帮助: 提高了士气,让人们愿意帮助他们,很重要的是可以帮助他们做出决定。
```

**Morale is tremendously important to a startup—so important that morale alone is almost enough to determine success. Startups are often described as emotional roller-coasters. One minute you're going to take over the world, and the next you're doomed. The problem with feeling you're doomed is not just that it makes you unhappy, but that it makes you stop working. So the downhills of the roller-coaster are more of a self fulfilling prophecy than the uphills. If feeling you're going to succeed makes you work harder, that probably improves your chances of succeeding, but if feeling you're going to fail makes you stop working, that practically guarantees you'll fail.**
```
士气对于初创公司是及其重要的-重要的是唯一决定着是否成功。初创公司往往被描述为不确定性的。现在你好像要统治世界,下一刻又要注定宣判了。这个让你被宣判的问题不仅仅在于让你不高兴,而是真正的让你停止工作。因此上坡下坡的过山车是自我实现的预言。如果你觉得你会成功,你就会更努力的工作,相反如果你觉得你要失败,你会消极工作,那么注定要失败。 
```

**Here's where benevolence comes in. If you feel you're really helping people, you'll keep working even when it seems like your startup is doomed. Most of us have some amount of natural benevolence. The mere fact that someone needs you makes you want to help them. So if you start the kind of startup where users come back each day, you've basically built yourself a giant tamagotchi. You've made something you need to take care of.**   
```
这就是非盈利性从何而来。如果你感觉你能真正的帮助人们,你会继续工作,甚至感觉初创是注定的。我们大多数人在这点上都有自然性。而事实也是有些人希望你能帮助他们。所以如果你仁慈的开始,人们会每天回访,你已经开始构建你自己的巨大的引力场。你用心的做了必须的事情。  
```

**Blogger is a famous example of a startup that went through really low lows and survived. At one point they ran out of money and everyone left. Evan Williams came in to work the next day, and there was no one but him. What kept him going? Partly that users needed him. He was hosting thousands of people's blogs. He couldn't just let the site die.**     
```
Blogger是一个著名的例子,经历了非常低调的初创和幸存。有次,他们用光所有的钱,所有的人都离开了。有一天,埃文-威廉姆斯来到办公室,发现除了他办公室一个人也没有。是什么让它坚持?因为有些用户需要他。他承载了上千人的博客。他不能让其就此死去。   
```

**There are many advantages of launching quickly, but the most important may be that once you have users, the tamagotchi effect kicks in. Once you have users to take care of, you're forced to figure out what will make them happy, and that's actually very valuable information.**     
```
迅速推出有很多优势,一旦你有了用户,你的引力场效应就会发挥作用。一旦你有了用户需要用心照顾,你就被迫的需要搞清楚什么能让他们高兴,而那才是真正有价值的信息。  
```

**The added confidence that comes from trying to help people can also help you with investors. One of the founders of Chatterous told me recently that he and his cofounder had decided that this service was something the world needed, so they were going to keep working on it no matter what, even if they had to move back to Canada and live in their parents' basements.**   
```
试着帮助别人能让你和你的投资者增加信心。Chatterous的创始人最近告诉我,他和他的联合创始人已经决定,这项服务是人们需要的,所以不管发生什么他们会一直努力工作下去,甚至要他们不得不搬回加拿大和他们的父母同住。  
```

**Once they realized this, they stopped caring so much what investors thought about them. They still met with them, but they weren't going to die if they didn't get their money. And you know what? The investors got a lot more interested. They could sense that the Chatterouses were going to do this startup with or without them.**   
```
一旦他们意识到这点,他们不在乎投资者如何看待他们。他们仍然见面,但是得不到他们的投资,他们也不会灭亡。你知道发生了什么吗?很多投资者非常的感兴趣。投资者能感觉得到Chatterous有或者没有他们的帮助他们都能做到。
```   

**If you're really committed and your startup is cheap to run, you become very hard to kill. And practically all startups, even the most successful, come close to death at some point. So if doing good for people gives you a sense of mission that makes you harder to kill, that alone more than compensates for whatever you lose by not choosing a more selfish project.**   
```
如果你保持很纯粹的初创,你会非常难以灭亡。而事实上所有的初创,甚至是那些最成功的,在某些时候也接近死亡。所以如果你能承担人们给你的责任感,你就很难灭亡,相比你选择一个自私的项目所失去的,你将会得到更多的补偿。   
```

#帮助
**Another advantage of being good is that it makes other people want to help you. This too seems to be an inborn trait in humans.**  
```
另一个优点就是使得别人会帮助你。这似乎是人与生俱来的特质。   
```
 
**One of the startups we've funded, Octopart, is currently locked in a classic battle of good versus evil. They're a search site for industrial components. A lot of people need to search for components, and before Octopart there was no good way to do it. That, it turned out, was no coincidence.**  
```
在我们资助的那些初创公司中,Octopart是一家关于善与恶的交锋的经典。他们是一个搜索工业部件的网站。许多人们需要搜索部件,并且在Octopart之前还没有很好的办法。事实证明,这并非巧合。  
```

**Octopart built the right way to search for components. Users like it and they've been growing rapidly. And yet for most of Octopart's life, the biggest distributor, Digi-Key, has been trying to force them take their prices off the site. Octopart is sending them customers for free, and yet Digi-Key is trying to make that traffic stop. Why? Because their current business model depends on overcharging people who have incomplete information about prices. They don't want search to work.**  
```
Octopart实现了搜索工作部件的正确方式。非常的受用户青睐,所以用户增长迅速。但是Octopart最大的分销商Digi-Key,一直迫使他们提供把网站的价格标注取消。Octopart免费提供给他们的用户,但是Digi-Key想要禁止。为什么呢?以你为他们当前的商业模式依靠于用户无法得到价格的完整信息所造成的投诉。他们想搜索无法正常工作。   
```

**The Octoparts are the nicest guys in the world. They dropped out of the PhD program in physics at Berkeley to do this. They just wanted to fix a problem they encountered in their research. Imagine how much time you could save the world's engineers if they could do searches online. So when I hear that a big, evil company is trying to stop them in order to keep search broken, it makes me really want to help them. It makes me spend more time on the Octoparts than I do with most of the other startups we've funded. It just made me spend several minutes telling you how great they are. Why? Because they're good guys and they're trying to help the world.**  
```
Octoparts是世界上最好的。他们放弃了在伯克利大学的物理学博士学位。他们仅仅是想解决他们在研究中遇到的问题。想象一下如果工程师都在能在线搜索那会节约多少时间啊。所以当我听到那个作恶的公司想要禁止他们继续让其无法搜索的时候,我发自内心的想要帮助他们。相对于其他的初创公司,我话费了很多时间在Octoparts上面。我刚刚花了几分钟的时间告诉你Octoparts有多么伟大。为什么呢?因为他们是最好的,他们尝试着帮助整个世界。  
```

**If you're benevolent, people will rally around you: investors, customers, other companies, and potential employees. In the long term the most important may be the potential employees. I think everyone knows now that good hackers are much better than mediocre ones. If you can attract the best hackers to work for you, as Google has, you have a big advantage. And the very best hackers tend to be idealistic. They're not desperate for a job. They can work wherever they want. So most want to work on things that will make the world better.**  
```
如果你是仁慈的,投资者、客户、公司、员工将团结在你周围。从长远来看,最重要的可能是潜在的雇员。我想每个人都知道好的黑客大大的好于平庸的。加入你能吸引最好的黑客为你工作,就像谷歌一样,那么你将具有巨大的优势。而最好的黑客往往是理想主意的。他们拼命不是为了工作。他们会在他们想在的任何地方工作。他们想要工作的事情是使这个世界变得更美好。
```

#指南
**But the most important advantage of being good is that it acts as a compass. One of the hardest parts of doing a startup is that you have so many choices. There are just two or three of you, and a thousand things you could do. How do you decide?**  
```
最重要的优势还是作为作为你的参考指南。做一个初创公司的最难的部分是,你面临很多选择,这儿你两个三个乃至上千个事情你可以做,你怎么决定?   
```

**Here's the answer: Do whatever's best for your users. You can hold onto this like a rope in a hurricane, and it will save you if anything can. Follow it and it will take you through everything you need to do.**   
```
答案在这: 为你的用户做最好的。它就想根救命稻草,不管遇到什么事情都可以拯救你。遵循它，它能带你通过一切障碍。
```    

**It's even the answer to questions that seem unrelated, like how to convince investors to give you money. If you're a good salesman, you could try to just talk them into it. But the more reliable route is to convince them through your users: if you make something users love enough to tell their friends, you grow exponentially, and that will convince any investor.**   
```
它甚至能回答看起来与问题无关的问题,比如投资者为什么要给你钱。如果你是一个优秀的推销员,你可以说服他们。但是更可靠的途径是通过你的用户说服他们:假如你能够让用户足够喜欢从而口口相传,你会成倍的增长,投资者也会心悦诚服。   
```

**Being good is a particularly useful strategy for making decisions in complex situations because it's stateless. It's like telling the truth. The trouble with lying is that you have to remember everything you've said in the past to make sure you don't contradict yourself. If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything, and that's a really useful property in domains where things happen fast.**    
```
做的好是一个特别有用的投资策略,因为它的无状态,尤其是复杂的情况下做出决定。它往往告诉你事实。说谎的代价就是你不得不记住你过去说过的每件事以确保不会自相矛盾。但是如果你说实话就没必要记得任何事情,这是一个在快速变化的领域非常有用的属性。    
```

**For example, Y Combinator has now invested in 80 startups, 57 of which are still alive. (The rest have died or merged or been acquired.) When you're trying to advise 57 startups, it turns out you have to have a stateless algorithm. You can't have ulterior motives when you have 57 things going on at once, because you can't remember them. So our rule is just to do whatever's best for the founders. Not because we're particularly benevolent, but because it's the only algorithm that works on that scale.**    
```
举个例子,YC孵化器现在资助了80个初创公司,其中57依然生机勃勃。(剩下的已经灭亡或者被并购。)当你要给57个初创公司建议的时候,不得不给出一个无状态的算法。当你一次面对57个事情的时候你不能别有用心,因为你根本记不住他们。所以规则仅仅就是对于创始人来说,什么是最好的。不仅仅是因为我们仁慈，但是它是唯一的可以搞定任意情况的算法。    
```

**When you write something telling people to be good, you seem to be claiming to be good yourself. So I want to say explicitly that I am not a particularly good person. When I was a kid I was firmly in the camp of bad. The way adults used the word good, it seemed to be synonymous with quiet, so I grew up very suspicious of it.**      
```
当你写东西告诉别人变得好,似乎是在声明你自己就是好的。所以我要明确的说明我不是一个特别好的人,当我还是小孩子的时候我往往站在坏的阵营里面。成年人用这个词好,它似乎是宁静的代名词,所以我从小就非常的可疑。   
```

**You know how there are some people whose names come up in conversation and everyone says "He's such a great guy?" People never say that about me. The best I get is "he means well." I am not claiming to be good. At best I speak good as a second language.**          
```
你知道的,人们谈论某些人名的时候总会问"它是一个伟大的人吗?"人们从不会说关于我的。我得到最好的就是"他说很好才行。"我不会说自己好,我说的最好是第二人称的。   
```

**So I'm not suggesting you be good in the usual sanctimonious way. I'm suggesting it because it works. It will work not just as a statement of "values," but as a guide to strategy, and even a design spec for software. Don't just not be evil. Be good.**    
```
所以我不建议你虚伪的变得好。我建议只是因为它确实有用。它不将仅仅是声明的"所谓价值",但作为战略指导,甚至是作为软件设计的规范。仅仅是不作恶。而是变好。
```
